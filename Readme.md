1. Sanitize File Names
Prevent malicious file names by sanitizing and renaming uploaded files.
$safeFileName = preg_replace("/[^A-Za-z0-9._-]/", "", basename($_FILES["file"]["name"]));
$target_file = $target_dir . time() . "_" . $safeFileName;

2. Restrict File Types with MIME Validation
Use MIME types for stricter file validation with finfo for accuracy.
$allowed_mimes = ["image/jpeg", "image/png", "application/pdf"];
$finfo = finfo_open(FILEINFO_MIME_TYPE);
$mime_type = finfo_file($finfo, $_FILES["file"]["tmp_name"]);
finfo_close($finfo);
if (!in_array($mime_type, $allowed_mimes)) {
    die("Invalid file type.");
}

3. Limit File Upload Size Server-Side
Enforce file size limits in PHP alongside HTML form restrictions.
$max_size = 5 * 1024 * 1024; // 5MB
if ($_FILES["file"]["size"] > $max_size) {
    die("File too large. Max size: 5MB.");
}

4. Generate Unique File Names
Avoid overwrites by appending timestamps or UUIDs to file names.
$unique_name = uniqid() . "_" . basename($_FILES["file"]["name"]);
$target_file = $target_dir . $unique_name;

5. Validate File Content (Image-Specific)
Check if an uploaded image is valid using getimagesize.
if (!getimagesize($_FILES["file"]["tmp_name"])) {
    die("File is not a valid image.");
}

6. Secure Upload Directory
Prevent direct access to the upload directory using .htaccess.
# Place in uploads/.htaccess
Deny from all

7. Implement Chunked Uploads for Large Files
Handle large files by splitting them into chunks (requires JavaScript + PHP).
// Example: Append chunk to file
$file_path = $target_dir . $_POST["file_name"];
file_put_contents($file_path, file_get_contents($_FILES["chunk"]["tmp_name"]), FILE_APPEND);

8. Use CSRF Protection
Protect file upload forms with CSRF tokens to prevent unauthorized submissions.
session_start();
$token = bin2hex(random_bytes(32));
$_SESSION["csrf_token"] = $token;

<input type="hidden" name="csrf_token" value="<?php echo $token; ?>">

if ($_POST["csrf_token"] !== $_SESSION["csrf_token"]) {
    die("Invalid CSRF token.");
}

9. Log Upload Activities
Track uploads for debugging or auditing purposes.
$log_message = date("Y-m-d H:i:s") . " - Uploaded: " . $_FILES["file"]["name"] . " by " . $_SERVER["REMOTE_ADDR"] . "\n";
file_put_contents("upload_log.txt", $log_message, FILE_APPEND);

10. Validate File Extensions Securely
Combine extension checks with MIME types for robust validation.
$allowed_extensions = ["jpg", "png", "pdf"];
$file_ext = strtolower(pathinfo($_FILES["file"]["name"], PATHINFO_EXTENSION));
if (!in_array($file_ext, $allowed_extensions)) {
    die("Invalid file extension.");
}

Pro Tips

Test in a Secure Environment: Always test uploads in a sandboxed environment to avoid security risks.
Backup Uploads: Regularly back up your uploads/ directory to prevent data loss.
Combine Techniques: Use multiple techniques (e.g., MIME validation + CSRF) for a robust system.
